# CSFCP Assignment 05(Capstone) – Vansh Negi

This repo contains the files for my CSFCP Assignment 5 (Career Planning & Automation).  
I am a first semester student so I am still learning git and linux, so this repo is simple only.

## 💼 What this repo has
- My bash script (create_career_structure.sh)
- Infographic I made on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Flowchart for Job Application Tracker
- Some screenshots of linux commands I practiced
- My assignment PDF (if I upload it later)

## 🧪 About the Bash Script
I made a small script that creates a folder called **Career_Stuff**  
Inside it there are folders like:
- Resume  
- Projects  
- Certificates  

This script is very basic because I am still learning shell scripting.

## 🧠 Infographic (AI Domain)
I made a 1-page infographic about AI.  
It includes:
- What is AI  
- Job roles  
- Salary range  
- Certifications  
- Indian startup (Niramai)

## 📊 Flowchart
I also made a simple flowchart for a Job Application Tracker.  
It shows steps like add, update, followups, etc.

## 📎 Note
This repo is only for my assignment submission and to upload all files in one place.  
I will improve my github skills slowly as I learn more in this semester.
